      <description>I’m Ryan Gentzler, Director of Open Justice Oklahoma at the Oklahoma Policy Institute.
Over the past three years, I’ve developed tools almost exclusively in R to scrape, analyze, visualize, and communicate data generated by Oklahoma’s justice system. As a state with one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, the need for a more transparent and accountable justice system could not be greater. Oklahoma also happens to have one of the most easily accessible and comprehensive court websites in the country, providing a unique opportunity to measure our justice system in real time.</description>
