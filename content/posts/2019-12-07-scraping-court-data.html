<p>I’m Ryan Gentzler, Director of <a href="http://www.openjusticeok.org">Open Justice Oklahoma</a> at the <a href="http://www.okpolicy.org">Oklahoma Policy Institute</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, I’ve developed tools almost exclusively in R to scrape, analyze, visualize, and communicate data generated by Oklahoma’s justice system. As a state with one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, the need for a more transparent and accountable justice system could not be greater. Oklahoma also happens to have one of the most easily accessible and comprehensive court websites in the country, providing a unique opportunity to measure our justice system in real time.</p>
<p>This, my personal website, will provide a tour of the tools we use, with an initial emphasis on the development of the <code>ojo</code> R package. My hope is that others with interests in courts, the justice system, and policy in general will find something useful here.</p>
